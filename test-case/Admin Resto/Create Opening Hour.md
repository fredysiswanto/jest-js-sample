## Test Data Setup

### Prerequisites:
1. Resto Admin user authenticated with valid JWT token
2. Restaurant owned by the resto admin
3. No existing opening hours for test days (for conflict testing)

### Sample Test Data:
```json
{
  "resto_admin_user": {
    "id": "resto-admin-uuid",
    "email": "testrestoadmin@foodtrip.com",
    "resto_id": "owned-resto-uuid"
  },
  "restaurant": {
    "id": "owned-resto-uuid",
    "resto_name": "Test Restaurant",
    "status": "Open"
  },
  "valid_days": [
    "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
    "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"
  ]
}
```

### Test Environment Variables:
- `{{base_url}}`: API base URL
- `{{resto_admin_token}}`: Valid JWT token for resto admin

---

## Response Validation Checklist

### For Successful Creation (201 Created):
- ‚úÖ Response contains `message` field
- ‚úÖ Response contains `data` array
- ‚úÖ Each opening hour has valid UUID `id`
- ‚úÖ Day names are properly formatted
- ‚úÖ Time format is HH:MM:SS
- ‚úÖ `resto_id` matches authenticated user's restaurant
- ‚úÖ `created_at` timestamp is present
- ‚úÖ Response time < 3 seconds

### For Validation Errors (400 Bad Request):
- ‚úÖ Response contains `message` field
- ‚úÖ Response contains `errors` object
- ‚úÖ Field-specific error messages
- ‚úÖ Multiple validation errors handled properly

### For Authorization Errors (401/403):
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication verification
- ‚úÖ Restaurant ownership validation
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control
- ‚úÖ Generic error messages for security

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control:
- üîê Only resto admin can create opening hours
- üîê Resto admin can only manage own restaurant's hours
- üîê JWT token validation on all requests
- üîê Restaurant ownership verification

### Data Validation:
- üõ°Ô∏è Day name validation against allowed values
- üõ°Ô∏è Time format validation (HH:MM:SS)
- üõ°Ô∏è Logical time validation (close > open)
- üõ°Ô∏è Duplicate day prevention
- üõ°Ô∏è Input sanitization for all fields

---

## Business Rules Validation

### Opening Hours Rules:
- ‚úÖ Days must be valid weekday names
- ‚úÖ Time format must be HH:MM:SS (24-hour)
- ‚úÖ Close time must be after open time
- ‚úÖ No duplicate days in single request
- ‚úÖ Cannot create duplicate opening hours for existing days
- ‚úÖ Must belong to authenticated admin's restaurant

### Data Constraints:
- **Required Fields:** day, open_time, close_time
- **Day Values:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
- **Time Format:** HH:MM:SS (00:00:00 to 23:59:59)
- **Array:** Minimum 1 opening hour entry

## Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Target Response Time | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Create Single Day | < 1 second | Simple validation and insert |
| Create Multiple Days | < 2 seconds | Batch processing |
| Create Full Week | < 3 seconds | 7 day entries with validation |

---

## Automation Notes

### High Priority for Automation:
- Test cases 1, 2 (successful creation scenarios)
- Test cases 4, 5, 6 (required field validation)
- Test cases 8, 10, 19 (business logic validation)
- Test cases 11, 12, 13 (authorization checks)

### Test Data Management:
- Clean existing opening hours before each test
- Use test restaurant for isolation
- Generate unique test scenarios
- Cleanup after test completion

### CI/CD Integration:
- Include in restaurant management test suite
- Validate opening hours business logic
- Monitor creation performance
- Test timezone handling if applicable
